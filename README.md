# TODO_List_App_With_User_Authentication
To Do list app with User Registration, Login, Search and full Create Read Update and DELETE functionality

"In this project, we aim to create a straightforward yet effective To-Do List application using Django. While we won't delve into an exhaustive overview of Django's capabilities, we'll focus on building a user-friendly application that covers essential functionality.

Our To-Do List app will enable users to perform fundamental tasks such as adding, updating, and marking items as complete. Additionally, we're incorporating a powerful search feature that allows users to quickly locate specific tasks by typing in relevant keywords. This intuitive search capability enhances user productivity.

Furthermore, we're implementing user registration and authentication features. Only registered users will be granted access to the application, and they will have their personalized view of tasks. Unauthorized users won't be able to access the list, ensuring data privacy and security.

We're choosing to leverage class-based views, a core feature of Django, to structure our application efficiently and maintainable. Class-based views provide a clean and organized way to handle different aspects of our To-Do List app.

Overall, this project will serve as a practical demonstration of creating a functional To-Do List application with Django, emphasizing user authentication and class-based views for a seamless user experience.
